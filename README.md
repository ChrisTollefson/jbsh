# jsonbash — The JSON Bourne Again Shell

This is a fork of the [json-bourne-shell](https://github.com/Breton/json-bourne-shell) project,
which is a fork of the [jason-bourne-shell](https://github.com/bostonaholic/jason-bourne-shell) project,
which is a fork of the [matt-daemon](https://github.com/searls/matt-daemon) project.

I'm not sure what the jsonbash project does yet, but I'm pretty excited about the name.
